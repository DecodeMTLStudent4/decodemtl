Welcome to DecodeMTL's full-stack web development bootcamp!

In this prep course, we compiled and organized a set of online resources that will help you get started with web development.

The goal of this prep course is to get your feet wet with programming, so that we can start the first day of class without wasting any time.

## Commitment
This preparatory material will take anywhere between 30-60 hours of hard work to complete. If you are applying to our full-time bootcamp, **completing this material before starting the bootcamp is mandatory**.

## Community and mentoring
If you are stuck, it's perfectly normal. Even though this is only a preparatory course, it does not make it easy. That being said, you are not alone in your quest :)

At the first sign of confusion, you should take a step back and re-read what has confused you. Search Google, MDN or Stack Overflow for answers to your questions.

If you get stuck for too long and cannot find a satisfactory answer online, don't hesitate to ping us on Slack. We may not always be available, but we will do our best to make sure you can complete the prep course in time, successfully.

## Part 1: Getting Started
In this part, we are going to get the tools necessary to start the prep work.

### Do your work
* #### [Download Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/){:target="_blank"}
  Google Chrome will be used as the main development browser during the training. Its integrated set of debugging tools makes developers' lives easier. Chrome's rendering engine is used by multiple browsers, giving you a good idea of what your pages would look like in many different settings.

* #### [Signup for a GitHub account](https://www.github.com/){:target="_blank"}
  Git and GitHub will be a constant part of our workflow. While Git will enable us to keep track of the history of code that we write and manage variations in our code, GitHub will enable us to share and collaborate the code we write.

  For this section, you are only tasked with signing up for a GitHub account. The last section of the prep material deals with your introduction to Git and GitHub.

  This is a good place to mention that your GitHub username and profile have the same visibility as your profiles on facebook, twitter or LinkedIn. GitHub is the network of code in the same manner that LinkedIn is the network of professionals.

  Employers will look at your GitHub profile for signs of your experience and interest. At this point, make sure to create a profile that represents you. Later on, we will fill your GitHub with various projects that will demonstrate the knowledge you have learned through DecodeMTL.

* #### [Signup to Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/register){:target="_blank"}
  Codecademy has tons of tutorials on many aspects of computing and development. We will be using it to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript.

* #### [Signup for Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io/){:target="_blank"}
  The same way we edit our spreadsheets in Open Office or Excel, web pages and web applications need their own editor. Cloud9 is an IDE — Integrated Development Environment — in the cloud. This is just technical mumbo-jumbo. It's a text editor on steroids, and already has installed most of the tools we will need during the bootcamp. Everything you do in Cloud9 is saved online, so you are able to start coding from any computer that has internet access. You don't even need to install anything on your machine.

  Make sure to use the **"Sign in with GitHub"** option when signing up to Cloud9. This will link your GitHub account to your Cloud9 account, allowing for an easier workflow between your code editor and source code repository.

  When you create a new workspace in Cloud9, you are actually creating a **virtual, linux-based computer**. In the next section, we will learn how to control this computer using the **Command Line**.

### Submit your work
If you are doing this prep work as part of your bootcamp application, login to Slack and submit the following information to your instructor:

* Your GitHub username
* Your Cloud9 username
* Your Codecademy username

## Part 2: Command Line
You are probably used to interacting with your computer through a mouse. A lot of the things you do on your computer use the mouse:

  * Opening an application by **double-clicking** on it
  * Moving a file to another directory by **dragging and dropping** it
  * Saving a file by **clicking** File > Save
  * Looking inside a directory by **double-clicking** on it
  * Deleting a file by **right-clicking** on it and then **clicking** on Remove or Delete.

But as a power-user, we often learn some keyboard shortcuts to make our life easier. For example, you should be familiar with `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C`) to copy some text, or perhaps `Cmd+Del` on a Mac to delete a file.

It turns out that all computer systems have a command line interface in addition to the graphical user interface we have become so accustomed to. Some systems that you will be dealing with as web developers do not even have a GUI.

For these reasons, you should be familiar enough with the CLI to perform some basic tasks. In order to gain familiarity with the CLI, go through the following readings and tutorials.

### Do your work
* #### [Read: The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/){:target="_blank"}
* #### [Read: Some Basic Unix Commmands](https://www.tjhsst.edu/~dhyatt/superap/unixcmd.html){:target="_blank"}
* #### [Read: Terminal 101: Aliases](http://www.techradar.com/how-to/computing/apple/terminal-101-creating-aliases-for-commands-1305638){:target="_blank"}
* #### [Do: Codecademy Command Line Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line){:target="_blank"}

### Submit your work
If you are doing this prep work as part of your bootcamp application, login to Slack and submit the following answers to your instructor:

* How do I figure out which directory I'm currently in?
* How do I list files sorted by the date they were last modified?
* How do I find out how much disk space a directory is using?

## Part 3: Programming with JavaScript
JavaScript is the main language of this bootcamp. We will be using JavaScript for the front-end -- the browser -- as well as the back-end -- the server and database. It is therefore crucial that you complete this section of the prep course before the first day of class.

### Do your work
* #### [Read: What is programming?](http://outspeaking.com/words-of-technology/what-is-programming.html){:target="_blank"}
  Read this to get a general overview of programming. As you get your hands dirty with code, it's always a good idea to remind yourself of the end-goal.

* #### [Do: Codecademy JavaScript track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript){:target="_blank"}
  This tutorial will get you familiar with the basics of the JavaScript language. As you go through the tutorial, don't hesitate to **supplement your knowledge** by looking at resources such as the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/){:target="_blank"}

* #### [Do: Codecademy jQuery track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery){:target="_blank"}
  This tutorial will show you the fundamentals of jQuery, a JavaScript library (fancy word for piece of code) that makes it easy to manipulate a web page live, without refreshing it.

* #### [Do: jQuery AJAX tutorial](https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/){:target="_blank"}
  This will be your first introduction to **asynchronous programming**. The JavaScript engine can only do one thing at a time, so when something takes too long we conceptually give JavaScript a "phone number where it can call us back", so that we can do other interesting things instead of waiting.

### Submit your work
If you are doing this prep work as part of your bootcamp application, login to Slack and submit the following answers to your instructor:

* Describe the activity of programming **in your own words**, using a few sentences.
* Create a JavaScript function that takes an integer as input, and **returns** all the prime factors of the number in an **array**. You don't need to pay attention to the performance of your code.
* Write a piece of jQuery code that uses the browser's `alert` function to open a popup when the user clicks on any `button` that has the class "`popup`".
* **Optional/Advanced**: Write a piece of AJAX code that fetches the [MDN search results for "javascript"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search.json?q=javascript){:target="_blank"} and prints the **title** of each search result on the console.

## Part 4: HTML & CSS
HTML and CSS are an integral part of web development. While HTML is used to give meaning to content, CSS is used to style that content.

### Do your work
* #### [Beginner guide to HTML and CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/){:target="_blank"}
  Read the full reference at your own pace. Keep a link to it in case you need to remind yourself of something you read :)

* #### [Do: Codecademy's HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web){:target="_blank"}
  This will supplement the knowledge that you earned by reading the beginner guide to HTML and CSS.

* #### [Do: Code School's CSS Cross Country](http://cssxcountry.codeschool.com/levels/1/){:target="_blank"}
  **Only complete level 1** of this course. If you wish to complete the other levels, you are most welcome to do so on your free time :)

* #### [Do: Code School's Chrome Dev Tools](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/discover-devtools){:target="_blank"}
  Go through **levels 1 and 2 only.** This will give you a good understanding of the tools we use on a daily basis to help us find bugs in our web pages.

### Submit your work
If you are doing this prep work as part of your bootcamp application, create a small HTML & CSS résumé that showcases what you have learned in this section.

When you are done -- don't spend more than a few hours on this -- login to Slack and submit your résumé to your instructor.

<div class="section-content">

## Part 5: Git & GitHub
Source code management is an integral part of writing software. Throughout the history of a piece of software, be it a web site, web application or other, changes will happen. Often, features that are not ready for prime-time will have to be developed **in parallel**. And in most cases, software will be worked on by **multiple developers**.

**Git** is a tool that empowers developers to accomplish these features without having to worry about the state of the project. If you've ever written a Word document, you may have found yourself creating a copy at some point, in order to try something else. Among other things, Git gives you the ability to branch off and create new features while keeping the working version of your software clean. It also lets you go back in time to a previous working version and examine it, without ever losing your work.

**GitHub** is like a "social network around Git". It is a platform that lets you publish your Git-managed projects online for others to see and collaborate on. Your GitHub profile is the equivalent of your LinkedIn profile for technical employers. In it, anyone can see what projects you have shared and contributed to. This is why it is important to document your adventures in web development by publishing as much of your work as possible to GitHub.

### Do your work
* #### [Do: Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1){:target="_blank"}
  Complete this Git tutorial provided for free by the nice people at GitHub. Git is a program that you have to install on your system. Fortunately in our case, since we are doing all our work inside the Cloud 9 IDE, Git is already installed for us. Cloud 9 has even already configured our Git installation to tag all the work we do with our name and e-mail address.
* #### [Read: Git, the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/){:target="_blank"}
  If you are feeling adventurous, you can try this Git tutorial on your own computer. However, it would be sufficient to use a Cloud9 workspace. If you remember, Cloud9 workspaces are actually virtual computers running the Linux operating system. Git is pre-installed as part of your Cloud9 development environment.

### Submit your work
If you are doing this prep work as part of your bootcamp application, login to Slack and submit the following answers to your instructor:

* Describe what is Git **in your own words**, using a few sentences.
* Describe what is GitHub **in your own words**, using a few sentences.
* Do you need an internet connection to use Git?
* Do you need an internet connection to use GitHub?
* What is the difference between `git add` and `git commit`?
* What is the difference between `git commit` and `git push`?

## You are done :)

Pat yourself on the back. If you've successfully completed all the sections above, you should now have a pretty solid introduction to many of the tools and languages used in web development.

Now would be a good time to look back at what you have done, and, with your newly acquired powers and skills, take all the assignments that you have done and publish them on GitHub as separate projects.

If you have any questions about the full-time class, don't hesitate to e-mail [hello@decodemtl.com](mailto:hello@decodemtl.com) with your questions :)
